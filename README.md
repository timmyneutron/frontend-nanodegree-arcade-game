## Getting Started

## Gameplay
### Characters

There are two characters - Player 1 (the Cat Girl) and Player 2 (the Boy).

### Controls

Player 1 is controlled with the w, a, s, and d keys, and Player 2 is controlled with the arrow keys.

### Rules

The board is covered with bugs! Ew! Try to get across the road to the water without hitting the bugs. As the game progresses, rocks will appear to block your way, and gems will appear (collect them to get more points!).

### Scoring

Certain actions are worth points:
 - Making it to the water = +1 point
 - Hitting a bug = -1 point
 - Collecting a blue gem = +2 points
 - Collecting an orange gem = +3 points
 - Collecting a green gem = +5 points
 
The first player to score 20 points wins!

### Restarting the game
 
To restart the game, refresh the web browser. Have fun!
